## Preface

With the advent of the AI era, scientific researchers and product
developers have the opportunity to free themselves from trivial
auxiliary tasks. Researchers with ambition but limited auxiliary
resources now have the chance to join the competitive landscape of
research. The focus of this competition is increasingly shifting toward
the researcher's ability to clearly define the logic of problems and
solutions. Formal modeling will provide researchers with a significant
advantage in leveraging AI.

This book takes Cancer Immunotherapy—a current hotspot in research—as a
case study to demonstrate modeling examples in this field. It explores
the feasibility of domain experts mastering modeling skills and leading
the modeling process.

Currently, Systems Biology and Computational Biology have established
widely accepted and used modeling standards, such as the graphical
representation SBGN, and text specifications like SBML and CellML,
accumulating a rich repository of models.

This book approaches the subject from the perspective of "Cross-Level
Unification" Starting from the microscopic biological level (molecules,
cells, tissues, organs, individuals) to the macroscopic healthcare
system level (personnel, equipment, institutions), we use the Systems
Modeling Language (SysML) developed by the OMG to model knowledge at
each level related to cancer immunotherapy, with the goal of creating
executable or simulation-ready “living” models that are
reusable—researchers can apply them across multiple research projects.
